Hi Everyone, 

Here's the slides from last week's sustainability meeting:: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N0GqvDO7VP5sPc_FpIUPgZZmE_U8rfGyP4B_0UA63mk/edit?usp=sharing 

Summary
- Shauhrat volunteered to help organize and to head up this committee. 
- We agreed to proceed with the "university pilot program” 
- We discussed use cases examples (see slides) 
- Shauhrat and Sara will work on researching token economic models for sustainability 
- We agreed on requirements for a "traceability system" - see below 

Traceability: 
- Add some flag like “provide_traceability” = 0/1 which will enable an authority to view the supply chain for the device. 
- The flag can only be set a bilateral agreement between the device owner and the authority. 
- The flag cannot be unset. The traceability agreement remains in force across all future transfers of the device.

The next meeting is already scheduled for next month. 

Best,
Rohi
