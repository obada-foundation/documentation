# Creating a unique deviceID

## Unique Device ID Format

There is no standard way to uniquely identify most electronic devices. A common approach is to concatenate the following fields as shown:

**product\_type-manufacturer-part(model)\_number-serial\_number**

- product type: desktop
- manufacturer: asustek\_computer\_inc
- part/model: 1000h
- serialnumber: 94oaaq021116

**Example:**

desktop\_computer-asustek\_computer\_inc-1000h-94oaaq021116

For this data to be interoperable, common terms for "product type" and "manufacturer name" must be used.  We propose these standard terms.

# Product Types
- computer_accessory
- computer_part
- consumer_electronics
- desktop_computer
- display
- laptop
- laptop_part
- mobile_device
- networking_device
- printer
- scrap
- storage_device

#Manufacturer Names
- apple
- cisco
- dell
- fujitsu
- hp
- ibm
- intel
- lenovo
- oracle
- samsung
- toshiba

These list will be extended as needed.
