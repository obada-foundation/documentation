Summary from email string:

## from Andrii:

* We have a t2.small EC2 instance with ubuntu 20.04 on it. 
* Additionally, we need a QLDB database so the IAM role configured for us must allow us to access it. 
* According to disk space for EC2, right now we have 100 GB EBS (a new type gp3). 
* According to firewall configuration, we need ports 22, 80, and 443. 
* Basically, that's all we need for the hosting node right now. 
* If you going to create a separate account for us, then I can configure everything with the Ansible playbook so you don't need to do anything except providing to me access tokens.
* Additionally have had few other apps that have dedicated instances but I don't know if we want to host them in the Usody AWS account.

@Rohi, Can you ask Andrii what settings Santiago should do to?
