## Mobile task force call - Jan 17

- User requirement:  blockchain should be able to answer questions like "who is the carrier" and "is it locked?".   
- on Riley stated that there are over 100 potential functional for mobile devices.  40-50 are commonly used. 
- diagnostic software does not have any standard format for these reports.

We created a "standardized" list of repair tests.   

ID | Property | Property
-- | ------------- | ---------
1 | mobile phone | lock status (is it locked?) 
2 | hard disk drive | number of hours 
3 | laptop | data- tatus (is-it-wiped?)


So repair software can read/write test results to the blockchain with the ID's on this list.

After the meeting, Don sent a more detailed list
