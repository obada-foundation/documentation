## Mobile task force call - Jan 17

Details from open discussion:
- User requirement:  blockchain should be able to answer questions like "who is the carrier" and "is it locked?".   
- Don Riley stated that there are over 100 potential functional for mobile devices.  40-50 are commonly used. 
- There is no standard format for diagnostic software reports.

We started a "standardized" list of repair tests (to allow repair software can read/write to the blockchain).  Should be generic enough to allow a repair test in any product type

ID | product type | property
-- | ------------- | ---------
1 | mobile phone | lock status (is it locked?) 
2 | hard disk drive | number of hours 
3 | laptop | data- tatus (is-it-wiped?)


Don sent this list of mobile device tests after the meeting:
